<h1>iCn3D Structure Viewer</h1>

<h2>iCn3D</h2>
"I see in 3D" (iCn3D) Structure Viewer is a WebGL-based 3D viewer using three.js and jquery. It is based on the 3D styles of <a href="http://webglmol.osdn.jp/index-en.html">GLMol</a> and <a href="http://istar.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/iview/">iView</a>. Here are some of the added features: picking atoms, selecting residues, shiny material for displaying, improved labeling, saving state, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We provided two versions of iCn3D widgets: <A HREF="index.html?mmdbid=2por">simple interface</A> and <A HREF="full.html?mmdbid=2por">advanced interface</A>. Both widgets can be easily added to web pages.
<ol>
<li>The simple interface has the minimum javascript code for the interface and is easy to understand. It has the basic features to change color and styles.
<li>The advanced interface has a library for the interface and is more complicated to understand. It has many features.
</ol>

<h2>Usage</h2>
Please see the <a href="//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/icn3d/icn3d.html">help page</a> to embed iCn3D in your page.

<h2>Third party Libraries used</h2>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery and JQuery UI</a></b>: used as a general tool to write Javascript code. Some JQuery UI features are used.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://threejs.org/">Three.js</a></b>: used to set up the 3D view.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tools based on</h2>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://istar.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/iview/">iview</a></b>: iCn3D is mainly based on iview.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://webglmol.osdn.jp/index-en.html">GLmol</a></b>: Some features (such as drawing cartoons for nucleotides) are from GLmol.</li>
</ul>
